acts as a master shortcut; it prompts a (configurable) menu selection which triggers various execution paths. 

## [get search query](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/dd73673d8f194c90aee7accea50c156c)
i dont trigger this directly, but as a sub-flow within another shortcut. you can use it from a google results web page by toggling "show in share sheet" in the shortcuts details.
